        successfully completing 30 credits, students may transfer into the B.S. degree.<br>Program Requirements:
        Additionally, as part of the ILS 499 Senior Capstone Course, students are required to do an internship
        consisting of 120 hours on-site at a library under the supervision of an MLS librarian. While many of our
        students have extensive backgrounds in ILS, the internship is still required and many students find this a great
        opportunity to explore a new area of library science they have not been able to experience.</p>

        graduate certificate in Substance Use Disorders to students seeking a career in a variety of social service
        settings. The program is designed for students to tailor a curriculum to match their career goals, whether that
        is working with young children, adolescents, adults, and older adults.. In the last 10 years, UMA’s MHHS program
        has graduated over 1,500 students with various degrees and certifications, approximately 800 were bachelor’s
        level students. Based upon a 2018 graduate survey, over 85% have gone on to employment in the field.</p>
    <h4 class="sub_header">UMA’s Mental Health & Human Services programs allow students to specialize in a variety of
        areas, and build a curriculum that meets their individual career goals.</h4>
    <p>There are four different concentrations each directed toward different avenues of career and professional
        development: Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation, Addictions Counseling, Child and Family Services and Mental
        Health and Human Services Generalist.</p>
    <p>The B.S. degree meets the academic requirement for the Licensed Social Worker-Conditional (LSX) credential, and
        students completing the Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation concentration qualify for the Mental Health
        Rehabilitation/Community (MHRT/C) credential.The B.S. degree meets the academic requirement for the Licensed
        Social Worker-Conditional (LSX) credential, and students completing the Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation
        concentration qualify for the Mental Health Rehabilitation/Community (MHRT/C) credential.The Graduate
        Certificate offers current professionals the flexibility to obtain a graduate certificate that can lead to

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Course Delivery</span> - Many MHHS students are returning students whose academic education was interrupted by
        parenthood, military service, or the economy and who bring their family and work commitments with them. To
        accommodate those needs, the MHHS program offers the opportunity to complete the majority
        of the courses online.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills You’ll Acquire</span> - Handling crises, managing caseloads, representing others (advocacy), providing
        psychosocial rehabilitation, counseling, job coaching, teaching life and career skills, providing educational
        support, coordinating support services, identifying and solving problems, and more.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sequence of Courses</span> - All University degrees have a specific curriculum which is made up of several components:
        Core and General Education, Program Requirements, Program Electives and General Electives. How a student goes
        about completing the curriculum is determined by where the student starts.<br>If you are just entering college
        we recommend taking your Core and General Education requirements during the first two years that you are here.
        That will ensure that you are fully prepared to take other courses later in your academic career.<br>If you are
        transferring into the program once your prior credits have been assessed, it will be important to make sure that
        you have completed the Core and General Education courses.<br>Regardless of which pathway brought you here,
        progressing through program requirements and electives is rather straight forward. We have simplified the
        process of selecting courses to ensure both continuity and choice for the student. The fundamental principle is
        to follow the numbers. Students are encouraged to take 100-level classes initially. These courses are general in
        nature and provide an entry into more advanced classes. 200-hundred level classes are primarily designed to
        develop and enhance skills and knowledge useful for more advanced classes. 300-level classes typically are
        building upon earlier courses. Finally, 400 level classes should be taken once the student has completed most of
        their undergraduate education. These courses prepare the student for the internship/capstone experience, then
        graduation and entry into either the profession or further education for a more advanced degree.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A special
            note regarding general electives.</span><br>The baccalaureate degree program in Mental Health and Human Services has
        many required classes, hence limiting the number of electives (5, three-credit courses). Students, particularly
        those transferring into the program, should be very cautious about taking courses that do not directly lead to
        the degree.<br>UMA’s Mental Health and Human Services’ Associate of Science degree is integrated within our
        baccalaureate program. Students can pursue a variety of potential career paths and earn an Associate’s degree
        along the way. The sequence of taking courses should be the same as the baccalaureate degree; take the Core and
        General Education courses during the first year and then follow the numbers, take the 100-level, then 200-level
        and finally the 300-level courses. Once you have fulfilled the required prerequisite courses you will need to
        take HUS 223 Fieldwork Preparation and then HUS 270 Fieldwork Placement I.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Criminal Background Check Policy:</span> Many agencies that provide mental health and human services field placement
        opportunities for students require a criminal background check. If a criminal background check indicates a
        conviction, this conviction may prevent you from securing a field placement, which is a required component of
        our degree programs. A conviction may also negatively impact your ability to get licensure to practice in the
        field of behavioral health. It is recommended that you contact the Licensure Board in the state(s) you plan to
        practice receiving specific information regarding their requirements. Other types of background checks, such as
        child protection or driving history, may be identified and required by the organization that is considering you
        for a field placement. If you have any doubts, please initiate a criminal background check yourself. This may
        include a Department of Motor Vehicle check as well.</p>

    <p>The Liberal Studies Bachelor of Arts program is ideal for students who enjoy a wide variety of academic
        interests, or those who haven’t found one passion. This program gives students a wide menu of courses to choose
        from, to develop a solid foundation in the humanities, social sciences, mathematics, and natural sciences.
        Students then choose a minor, rather than a major, in one area.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Career Outcomes</span> - Students with a Liberal Arts degree are poised to be successful in a number of areas, as it
        prepares thoughtful and creative readers, writers, thinkers, and problem solvers. Our majors go into business,
        education, government, health fields, and social/human services and policy. There really is no career area that
        isn’t served by a Liberal Studies degree.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Outcomes</span> - Graduates of the program will have the following:<br>effective verbal and written
        communication skills<br>the ability to think critically and creatively problem solve<br>a foundation in
        humanities, natural and social sciences<br>computer and technological skills appropriate to contemporary
        workplace environments<br>skills for research and lifelong learning<br>an awareness of global and multi-cultural
        concerns</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sample Curriculum</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">First Year / Freshman In the first year</span>, students typically take ENG 101:  College Writing, designed to prepare
        for a variety of academic writing.  This is followed by ENG 102W:  Introduction to Literature, which introduces
        fundamentals of literary analysis through close reading of poetry, short fiction, and drama. These two courses
        show students writing as a process, introduce research methods, and model critical reading skills. Math and lab
        sciences are also useful to complete early in a student’s course of study, as well as a communications class and
        introduction to computing. Other requirements can be filled in any number of sequences. The sample curriculum
        below offers an example of first year courses.<br>ENG 101:  College Writing<br>ENG 102W:  Introduction to
        Literature<br>MATH 100: Math and Its Applications<br>BIO 100: Human Biology or BIO 104: Introduction to Human
        Nutrition<br>COM 101: Public Speaking or COM 102: Interpersonal Communication<br>CIS 100: Introduction to
        Computing<br>One Humanities course (American Studies, Drama, English, History, Music, Philosophy, or Women’s
        Studies)<br>Fine Arts Elective (studio art, creative writing, or music)</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Year / Sophomore In students’ second year</span>, they may take classes that build on their reading, writing,
        speaking, listening, and problem solving skills developed in the first year. The sample curriculum below is one
        example.<br>Two semesters of a foreign language, such as American Sign Language or French<br>Two semesters of
        Social Science (from two different disciplines), such as Sociology or Psychology<br>One Research Methods class
        <br>One Fine Arts Elective<br>One class in student’s choice of minor</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Year / Junior and Fourth Year / Senior</span> In this sample, all General Elective Requirements were completed in
        students’ first two years. This opens the third and fourth year to upper level electives and classes in a
        student’s chosen minor.</p>
