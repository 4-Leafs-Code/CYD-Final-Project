# CYD-Final-Project
I built a website called Women Residents Services as the final project for the Spring/22 Code Your Dreams course. 
I had only learned to code about 3 months prior to this project. 

This site was intended for a secure facility. 
There are 2 levels of Administrators.
Only Administrators are able to add user accounts. 

I wrote in python, flask, and sqlalchemy on the backend.
I wrote in html, and css with a splash of bootstrap and javascript. 

This site is functional but please remember this is only the MVP.

First thing:
run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell.
    
There is a database file. To add more users:
* Open database.py   
* Uncomment line 91
* Run database.py
* Comment line 91 again
* Run main.py
* click on address in terminal

In order to move past the login screen and see the rest of the site
you will need to add a user to the database from the backend or use   
the credentials below to login. 

Then you should be able to log in with the Resident A credentials:
* UserName: Resident.A
* Password: Password

I rebuilt this site for Summer/22 [Intro. to Web Design](https://github.com/4-Leafs-Code/IntroToWebDesignFP) course.
