# CYD-Final-Project
I built a website called Women Residents Services as the final project 
for the Code Your Dreams course. I had only learned to code about 3 months
prior to this project. 

I wrote in python, flask, and sql-lite on the backend.
I wrote in html, and css with a splash of bootstrap and javascript. 

This code is not entirly functional at the moment. I seened to have misplaced 
my user class program sence I compleated the fall/21 course . 

I compleated the Intro. to Web Design Spring/22 course and rebuilt this site.
I will be including a link to direct you that repo once I have it posted.
