# CYD-Final-Project
I built a website called Women Residents Services as the final project 
for the Fall/21 Code Your Dreams course. I had only learned to code about 3 months
prior to this project. 

This site was intended for a secure facility. There are 2 levels of Administrators.
Only Administrators are able to add user accounts. 

I wrote in python, flask, and sqlalchemy on the backend.
I wrote in html, and css with a splash of bootstrap and javascript. 

This site is not entirly functional at the moment. This is only the MVP.

There is not a database file yet. 

In order to move past the login screen and see the rest of the site
you will need to add Resident A to the database from the backend. 

Then you should be able to login with the Resident A cridentials:
*UserName: Resident.A
*Password: Password

I compleated the [Intro. to Web Design](https://github.com/4-Leafs-Code/IntroToWebDesignFP) Spring/22 course and rebuilt this site


Note to self: pip install sqlalchemy and flask_login.
Learn how to make a requirements file.
